# Global Search with Metadata Filters

## Description

`pillar search` works well for text, but metadata filtering would be a game changer.

Request: `pillar search "protocol" --status todo --priority high`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Support for filtering search results using metadata flags (`--status`, `--priority`, `--project`, `--milestone`).
- [ ] Improved search ranking based on relevance.
- [ ] Ability to search through frontmatter fields specifically.
